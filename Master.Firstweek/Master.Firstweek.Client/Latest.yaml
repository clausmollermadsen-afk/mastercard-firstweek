  title: Accept Payments API
  description: "# Introduction\n\nThis API focuses on providing Accept Payments use cases for Payment Initiation and managing Payment Mandates powered by Open Banking.\n\n## Authentication\n\nClient Authentication will be based on the OAuth 2 Client Credentials flow with `private_key_jwt` (See [OpenId 1.0 - Client Authentication](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication)). This means the you will authenticate towards our API by providing a JWT signed by the private key of an asymmetric private-public key pair. The key pair will be generated by you and the public certificate shared with us during onboarding.\n\n## Paging\n\nThe endpoints that return a list of results support paging.\n\nThese endpoints can be controlled through the query parameters `limit` and`offset`. Limit will ensure that only that number of items are returned. Offset will control how many items will be skipped before returning the results. \n\n`GET /resources?offset=5&limit=5` will return resources 6 to 10. \n\nIf a limit is not specified, then the default limit applies.\n\n## Error handling\n\nSuccessful responses in the API return HTTP `200` or `201` if the response is immediate or HTTP `202` if the request has been accepted for asynchronous processing.\n\nIn case of errors, the API returns a JSON response containing the error code and details about the failure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Errors\": {\n    \"Error\": [\n      {\n        \"Source\": \"Accept Payments API\",\n        \"ReasonCode\": \"INVALID_INPUT\",\n        \"Description\": \"Validation error occurred for the property: RedirectUrl\",\n        \"Recoverable\": false,\n        \"Details\": \"The RedirectUrl field is required.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe format and the keys of the error `details` varies between error codes.\n\n## Correlation IDs\n\nThe API supports [hierarchical request IDs](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource/src/HierarchicalRequestId.md) via the optional header `X-Correlation-Id`:\n\n```text\nX-Correlation-Id: <your Correlation Id>\n```\n\nThis allows tracing calls across systems and is helpful in debugging.\n\nThe correlation ID should be unique and must begin with `|` and end with `.`. Everything in between must be a character (`A-Za-z`), digit (`0-9`), underscore (`_`) or dash (`-`). The maximum length is 128 characters.\n\nThe correlation ID is returned in every response in the `X-Correlation-Id` header.\n\n## Idempotency\n\nThe API supports idempotency on all POST, PUT and PATCH requests if the optional header `X-Request-Id` is in the request:\n\n```text\nX-Request-Id: <your request Id>\n```\n\nIn the event that a network error or similar causes a request to fail, you can retry the request with the same X-Request-Id-header. If we have already processed the request, we will return a cached response and won't actually process the request. In the event that the first request hasn't yet finished processing, we will return a `HTTP 409 Conflict` to indicate that we can't process the second request while the first request is ongoing. You can wait for the first request to complete or try the request again.\n\n# Webhooks\n\nWebhooks are notifications about particular events sent from the server to the clients.\nIn technical terms, a webhook is a web request that the server sends to a web address belonging to the client when specific events happen. The request is comprised of a JSON body that includes information with more details about the event.\n\nWe use the term “notification” and “webhook” interchangeably in our documentation.\n\n### Create a webhook endpoint\nThe first step is to create an endpoint on the client's web service that:\n* Can receive a POST request with a JSON body\n* Can acknowledge the call by returning a 200 status code\n* Is public so that it can be called from our servers\n\nThese will allow the client's web service to receive webhooks with a payload allowing the client to act on notifications.\n\n### Acknowledgement of notification\nTo acknowledge that a notification has been received, a 200 HTTP status code must be returned within a timeout. All other response codes indicate that the webhook has not been received successfully.\n\nIt’s important to acknowledge the notification as soon as possible so that we know that it has been received, otherwise we will retry the notification attempt 10 times with an exponential backoff strategy.\nWe encourage returning a 200 HTTP status as soon as possible, before executing any complex logic, in order to avoid possible timeouts.\n\n\n\n### Register webhook URL\nWebhook URLs are configured during client onboarding.\n\nPlease ensure that the webhook endpoint is configured to use HTTPS with a valid certificate.\n\nDuring webhook configuration, a secret used to validate that the notification is actually originating from MCOBS will also be necessary. Read more in the section below.\n\n### Delivery headers\nA request to your configured webhook URL has several special headers:\n\n<table>\n    <th>Header</th>\n    <th>Description</th>\n    <tr>\n        <td>X-Correlation-Id</td>\n        <td> \n\nA unique identifier value that’s attached to the request. See [Correlation Ids](#section/Introduction/Correlation-IDs)\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>X-Mcobs-Event</td>\n<td>The type of event that triggered the delivery.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>X-Mcobs-Signature</td>\n<td>HMAC-SHA256 of body. See below for more information.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Security\nMCOBS adds a X-Mcobs-Signature header which allows the client to verify that webhook is sent by us.\n\nHere’s a C# example on how to generate such a signature:\n```csharp\n string Generate(string payload, string secret)\n {\n    var encoding = new UTF8Encoding();\n\n    var textBytes = encoding.GetBytes(payload);\n    var keyBytes = encoding.GetBytes(secret);\n\n    byte[] hashBytes;\n\n    using (var hash = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes))\n    {\n        hashBytes = hash.ComputeHash(textBytes);\n    }\n\n    return BitConverter.ToString(hashBytes).Replace(\"-\", \"\").ToLower();\n }\n```\nThe body needs to be read as a string (deserialization might interfere with the order of keys, making the signature wrong).\n\nOnce you have generated a signature from the webhook request, you should compare its value against the X-Mcobs-Signature header’s value. If they match, the webhook was generated by MCOBS and can be considered safe.\n\n## Payloads\n\nThe webhook bodies have the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"webhook-type\",\n  \"data\": {},\n  \"retryCount\": 0\n}\n```\n\nThe `data` object depends on the `type` field. See the below tables for examples.\n\n### Accept Payment Webhooks\n\n<table>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example payload data</th>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AcceptPaymentStatusUpdated</td>\n<td>\n\nTriggered when the status of an accept payment changes.\nYou should call the [Get payment endpoint](#tag/Accept-Payments/operation/Accept%20Payments%20GetPayment) to get the\nlatest status\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"paymentId\": \"acb29db6-70df-4c99-888c-d8485cd40c3d\",\n  \"executionTime\": \"2024-01-01T12:34:56.123456+00:00\"\n}\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n### Payment Mandate Webhooks\n\n<table>\n\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Example webhook data</th>\n<tr>\n<td>MandateStatusUpdated</td>\n<td>\n\nTriggered when the status of a payment mandate changes.\nYou should call the [Get payment mandate endpoint](#tag/Payment-Mandates/operation/Payment%20Mandates%20GetMandate) to get the latest status\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"mandateId\": \"acb29db6-70df-4c99-888c-d8485cd40c3d\",\n    \"executionTime\": \"2024-01-01T12:34:56.123456+00:00\"\n}\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n</table>"
